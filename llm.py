INSTRUCTIONS: Analyze this image with EXTREME precision. Extract and list EVERYTHING visible, especially background details that are often missed.

FIELDS TO ANALYZE:
1. BACKGROUND TEXT & OCR: 
   - Transcribe ALL visible text, even if small, blurred, or in the background.
   - Look for text on any surface in the image (ONLY IF ACTUALLY PRESENT).
   - If there are mathematical formulas, scientific equations, or code snippets, transcribe them exactly.
2. PEOPLE & ACTIONS: 
   - Describe specific physical actions ONLY IF PEOPLE ARE PRESENT.
   - Detail their posture, gestures, eye contact.
3. VISIBLE OBJECTS & ITEMS (CRITICAL - EXHAUSTIVE LIST):
   - List EVERY SINGLE concrete physical object you see in the image.
   - Categorize mentally: Food, Drink, Furniture, Decor, Electronics, Tools, Vehicles, Nature.
   - Mention specific models, types, materials, and colors when possible.
4. SCENE & ENVIRONMENT:
   - Detail the lighting (natural, neon, cinematic, dim) and shadows.
   - Describe the depth of field and focus.
5. PROPER NOUNS (CRITICAL - extract ALL of these as complete keywords):
   - PLACE NAMES: cities, countries, landmarks, buildings
   - BRAND NAMES: logos, product names, company names
   - PERSON NAMES: if identifiable from context (name tags, credits, watermarks)
   - ORGANIZATION NAMES: schools, companies, government agencies visible in the image
   - Keep proper nouns in their ORIGINAL language too (e.g., "東京タワー", "台北101")

CRITICAL:
- Respond ONLY with a JSON object. All content must be in English.
- Summary: 2-4 sentences capturing the core context AND the most defining background detail.
- Keywords: Include 40-70 keywords. MUST include all objects from step 3 and text from step 1.
- CRITICAL: ANTICIPATE HALLUCINATIONS. DO NOT invent items. ONLY list objects that are explicitly visible in the pixels of the image.
- CRITICAL: Multi-word terms MUST be kept as a single keyword:
  - "Eiffel Tower" NOT "Eiffel", "Tower"
